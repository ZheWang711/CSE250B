## Introduction

* Difference between algorithms and machine learning: **the input-output mapping cannot easily be made precise**.
* 4 types of output space: ** discrete, continuous, probability values, more general structures **.

## Categorization of machine learning
* Discrete output space: **classification**
    * binary classification
    * multiclass classification
* Continuous output space **regression**
* Conditional probability functions
* Structured output spaces

* Supervised vs. unsupervised learning: we have *vs.* haven't outcome measurement (quantitatively or categorically) based on a set of features.
